**Parameter Name**                        | **Default Value**           | **Description** 
----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**`tracker`**                             | `null`                      | Name of the tracker resource in Amazon Location Service to send location updates.  If you don't provide a tracker name, then the default tracker in Amplify configuration is used.
**`desiredAccuracy`**                     | `FINE`                      | A value to request the desired level of accuracy of location updates.  The requested desired accuracy is not guaranteed to be achieved.
**`powerRequired`**                       | `LOW`                       | A value to request the desired amount of power used for location updates.  This value impacts the accuracy, frequency and latency of location updates.
**`disregardLocationUpdatesWhenOffline`** | `false`                     | If true, the app will not store location updates when the app is offline. This is false by default; Amplify will store location updates locally due to loss of network connectivity and send location updates when app is online.
**`minUpdateDistanceMeters`**             | `0`                         | The minimum distance between location updates in meters.  If a potential location update's distance from the previous does not exceed this threshold, it will not occur.  0 represents no minimum update distance.
**`minUpdatesInterval`**                  | `0`                         | The minimum time between location updates in milliseconds.  If a potential location update's time since the previous does not exceed this threshold, it will not occur.  0 represents no minimum update time difference.
**`maxUpdates`**                          | `Integer.MAX_VALUE`         | The maximum amount of location updates this Location Manager will receive before stopping requests.
**`trackUntil`**                          | `null`                      | If set, the app will stop tracking when date is reached. By default, tracking will continue until user logOut or `stopTracking()` is called.
**`batchingOptions`**                     | `.none()`                   | Custom defined behavior to send location updates in batches based on a specified threshold.
**`proxyDelegate`**                       | `null`                      | If set, the app will send location updates by calling the `updatePositions(List<GeoPosition> positions)` function on this user-defined object instead of uploading to Amazon Location Services.
