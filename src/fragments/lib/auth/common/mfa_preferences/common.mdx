You can use Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your web or mobile applications. Amplify's Auth category includes support for handling TOTP setup and codes, offering an integrated solution for enhanced security for your users. Authenticator apps generate the temporary, one-time passwords. These apps, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, have the TOTP algorithm built-in and work by using a shared secret key and the current time to generate a short-lived password.

The APIs for fetching and updating MFA preferences are only available on the AWS Cognito Auth plugin and not on the Auth category.

## Fetch the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to get the MFA preference for the current user.

import iosFetchMFAPreference from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/ios/mfa_preference/10_fetch_mfa_preference.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: iosFetchMFAPreference}} />

## Update the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to update the MFA preference for the current user.

<Callout warning>

Only one MFA method can be marked as preferred at a time. If the user has multiple MFA methods enabled and tries to mark more than one MFA method as preferred, the API will throw an error.

</Callout>

import iosUpdateMFAPreferences from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/ios/mfa_preference/20_update_mfa_preference.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: iosUpdateMFAPreferences}} />

If multiple MFA methods are enabled for the user, the `signIn` API will return `continueSignInWithMFASelection` as the next step in the auth flow. During this scenario, the user should be prompted to select the MFA method they want to use to sign in.

Refer to the [Continue signin with MFA Selection](/lib/auth/signin_next_steps#continue-signin-with-mfa-selection) section for more details.

<b>AWS Cognito Limitation</b>

The `fetchMFAPreference` API will only return enabled and preferred MFA methods, if the preferences were set using the `updateMFAPreference` API. If the preferences were not set using the `updateMFAPreference` API, the MFA preferences will return `nil` for enabled and preferred MFA methods. 

Therefore it is recommended to use the `updateMFAPreference` API to set the MFA preferences for the user, if the user decides to set up any MFA methods. An example use case would be that when a user successfully sets up TOTP using the `setupTOTP` and `verifyTOTPSetup` API, `updateMFAPreference` should be invoked to set the MFA preferences for the user i.e. marking TOTP as enabled.
