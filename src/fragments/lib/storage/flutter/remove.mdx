To delete an object uploaded to S3, use `Amplify.Storage.remove` and specify the key:

```dart
Future<void> deleteFile() async {
  try {
    final RemoveResult result =
        await Amplify.Storage.remove(key: 'ExampleKey');
    print('Deleted file: ${result.key}');
  } on StorageException catch (e) {
    print('Error deleting file: $e');
  }
}
```
