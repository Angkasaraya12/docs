Models with one-to-many connections are lazy-loaded when accessing the connected property, so accessing a relation is as simple as:

<Block name="Async/Await">

```swift
do {
    guard let queriedPost = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Post.self, byIdentifier: "123")),
            let comments = queriedPost.comments else {
        return
    }
    // call fetch to lazy load the postResult before accessing its result
    try await comments.fetch()
    for comment in comments {
        print("\(comment)")
    }
} catch let error as DataStoreError {
    print("Failed to query \(error)")
} catch let error as CoreError {
    print("Failed to fetch \(error)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error \(error)")
}
```

    Task {

                print("\(comment)")

The connected properties are of type `List<M>`, where `M` is the model type, and that type is a custom [Swift Collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection), which means that you can `filter`, `map`, etc:

```swift
let excitedComments = comments
    .compactMap { $0.content }
    .filter { $0.contains("Wow!") }
```

Models with many-to-one connections are lazy-loaded when accessing the connected property, so accessing a relation is as simple as:

```swift
do {
    guard let queriedComment = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Comment.self, byIdentifier: "123")) else {
        return
    }

    // `await` on the post to lazy load it
    let post = try await queriedComment.post    
    print("\(post)")
} catch let error as DataStoreError {
    print("Failed to query \(error)")
} catch let error as CoreError {
    print("Failed to fetch \(error)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error \(error)")
}
```

    }
} receiveValue: { queriedComment in
    guard let queriedComment = queriedComment else {
        return
    }
    Task {
        // `await` on the post to lazy load it
        let post = try await queriedComment.post    
        print("\(post)")
    }
