The following examples have a minimum version requirement of the following:

- Amplify CLI v10.8.0
- Amplify Library for Swift v2.4.0
- The feature flag `generateModelsForLazyLoadAndCustomSelectionSet` should be set to `true` to support certain examples on this page. If you are building a new project, this flag will be true by default in Amplify CLI v12.5.0??. If you are working on an existing project and would like to turn this feature flag on, see [migration guide](/cli/migration/lazy-load-custom-selection-set/#where-do-i-make-these-changes) for more details.
