# Connect a data stack
In this guide, you will learn how to connect an existing data stack to your application. This job includes understanding the required client configuration and how to connect the data stack. We will also review functions to create, read, update, and delete your data using the Amplify GraphQL client. Finally, we will look at how to subscribe to real-time events to watch for mutations in your data.

## Review the required configuration

In this job, you will configure your client to point to the AWS AppSync API endpoint. You will first need to understand how to configure the Amplify API category and update the authentication type to complete this job. An understanding of the differences between authentication types will also be helpful if you did not set up the data stack yourself.

> **Before you begin, you will need:**
> - An AWS AppSync API already set up ([Designing a GraphQL API in AppSync]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html)]
> - An application set up ([instructions to set up an app](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/))

### Configure the client to point to the AWS AppSync API endpoint and update authentication details

[comment]: # (This section includes both a short intro that helps to explain how to configure the Amplify API category and the steps to configure the client. Also includes a short review of the auth types and steps to update their details required in this command. Content copied and updated from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/edit/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/existing-resources.mdx )

[question]: # (Do we need any content from these pages for this job? 1- https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/client-configuration/configuring-amplify-categories/q/platform/js/#graphql-api-aws-appsync ; 2- https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/client-code-generation/#amplify-add-codegen ; 3- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/building-a-client-app.html )

You can use existing AWS AppSync resources by referencing the AWS AppSync API endpoint and configuring the parameters in your app. The API URL, ID, and Key can be found in the AWS AppSync console in the Settings section. 
You will need to know your Authentication type to complete this step. Authentication type options are `API_KEY`, `AWS_IAM`, `AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS` and `OPENID_CONNECT`.

#### Review differences between authentication types 

[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION to provide a deeper dive on authentication types and their differences, including API key access, Cognito, IAM, and OIDC. May be an option for a table that compares the authentication types. Content copied and updated from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/pages/cli/graphql/authorization-rules.mdx However, I would suggest we rewrite this intro sentence to provide more foundational explanation that we can then reuse.)

Below is a short comparison between the different authentication types and their use cases. 

| **Recommended use case** | **Strategy** | **Provider** |
|---|---|---|
| Public data access where users or devices are anonymous. Anyone with the AppSync API key is granted access. | [`public`]() | `apiKey` |
| Recommended for production environment's public data access. Public data access where unauthenticated users or devices are granted permissions using AWS IAM controls. | [`public`]() | `iam` |
| Per user data access. Access is restricted to the "owner" of a record. Leverages `amplify add auth` Cognito user pool by default. | [`owner`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Any signed-in data access. Unlike owner-based access, **any** signed-in user has access. | [`private`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` / `iam` |
| Per user group data access. A specific or dynamically configured group of users have access | [`group`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Define your own custom authorization rule within a Lambda function | [`custom`]() | `function` |

Once you have these details you can configure the client:

#### Using with an AppSync custom domain name

[Custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/custom-domain-name.html) can be used to create a memorable endpoint with a domain name of your choice. These can have any format, but must end with `/graphql` (see https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#uris-routes). Using custom domain names will impact how you enter your graphqlEndpoint:

```javascript
const myAppConfig = {
  // ...
  aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/graphql',
  aws_appsync_region: 'us-east-1',
  aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'API_KEY' // All auth modes are supported
  // ...
};

Amplify.configure(myAppConfig);
```

[question]: # (Do we want to address non-AppSync on this job or link to it? )

### Using a non-AppSync GraphQL Server

To access a non-AppSync GraphQL API with your app, you need to configure the endpoint URL in your app’s configuration. Add the following line to your setup:

```js
import { Amplify, API } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

// Considering you have an existing aws-exports.js configuration file
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

// Configure a custom GraphQL endpoint
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https:/www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint'
  }
});
```

#### Set Custom Request Headers for non-AppSync GraphQL APIs

When working with a non-AppSync GraphQL endpoint, you may need to set request headers for authorization purposes. This is done by passing a `graphql_headers` function into the configuration:

```js
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_headers: async () => ({
      'My-Custom-Header': 'my value'
    })
  }
});
```

#### Signing Request with IAM

AWS Amplify provides the ability to sign requests automatically with AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) for GraphQL requests that are processed through AWS API Gateway. Add the `graphql_endpoint_iam_region` parameter to your GraphQL configuration statement to enable signing:

```js
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https://www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint',
    graphql_endpoint_iam_region: 'my_graphql_apigateway_region'
  }
});
```

### Recap
At this point your client is now configured to point to your AppSync API endpoint and you updated your authentication details based on the auth types you are using.

## Enable queries, mutations, and subscriptions

Now that the GraphQL API has deployed, it’s time to learn how to interact with it from a JavaScript client application. With GraphQL, you typically have the following types of operations:

- __Mutations__ - write data to the API (create, update, delete operations)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { CreateTodoInput, CreateTodoMutation, UpdateTodoMutation, DeleteTodoMutation } from './API';

const todo: CreateTodoInput = { name: "My first todo", description: "Hello world!" };

/* create a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<CreateTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {input: todo}));

/* update a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<UpdateTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(updateTodo, { input: { id: todoId, name: "Updated todo info" }}));

/* delete a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<DeleteTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(deleteTodo, { input: { id: todoId }}));
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations';

const todo = { name: "My first todo", description: "Hello world!" };

/* create a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {input: todo}));

/* update a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(updateTodo, { input: { id: todoId, name: "Updated todo info" }}));

/* delete a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(deleteTodo, { input: { id: todoId }}));
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

- __Queries__ - read data from the API (list, get operations)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const todos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>(graphqlOperation(listTodos));
```

</Block>


<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';

const todos = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listTodos));
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

- __Subscriptions__ - subscribe to changes in data for real-time functionality (onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLSubscription } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { onCreateTodo } from './graphql/subscriptions';
import { OnCreateTodoSubscription } from './API';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const sub = API.graphql<GraphQLSubscription<OnCreateTodoSubscription>>(
    graphqlOperation(onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
    next: (payload) => {
      const createdTodo = payload.value.data?.onCreateTodo;
      console.log(createdTodo);
    }
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
sub.unsubscribe();
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { onCreateTodo } from './graphql/subscriptions';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const sub = API.graphql(
    graphqlOperation(onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
    next: (payload) => {
      const createdTodo = payload.value.data?.onCreateTodo;
      console.log(createdTodo);
    }
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
sub.unsubscribe();
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Updating Your GraphQL Schema

When you create a GraphQL backend with the CLI, the schema definition for your backend data structure is saved in one of two places:

1. By default, schemas are saved in *amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/schema.graphql*. If the `schema.graphql` file exists, it will take precedence over option 2.
2. Optionally, schemas may be saved as a set of `.graphql` files stored in the *amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/schema/* directory. E.g. you might have files `Query.graphql`, `User.graphql`, and `Post.graphql`.

Once your API is deployed, updating the schema is easy with the CLI. You can edit the schema file(s) and run *amplify push* command to update your GraphQL backend.

For example, a sample GraphQL schema will look like this:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

Add a *priority* field to your Todo type:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  priority: String
}
```

Save your schema file and update your GraphQL backend:

```bash
amplify push
```

When you run the *push* command, you will notice that your schema change is automatically detected, and your backend will be updated respectively.

```console
| Category | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Api      | myapi           | Update    | awscloudformation |
```

When the update is complete, you can see the changes to your backend by running the following command and select GraphQL option.

```bash
amplify api console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: (Use arrow keys)
❯ GraphQL
  REST
```

### Using GraphQL Transformers

As you can notice in the sample schema file above, the schema has a `@model` directive. The `@model` directive leverages a set of libraries that can help simplify the process of bootstrapping highly scalable, serverless GraphQL APIs on AWS. The `@model` directive tells the GraphQL Transform that you would like to store Todo objects in an Amazon DynamoDB table and configure CRUD operations for it. When you create or update your backend with *push* command, the CLI will automatically create and configure a new DynamoDB table that works with your AppSync API. The `@model` directive is just one of multiple transformers that can be used by annotating your *schema.graphql*.

The following directives are available to be used when defining your schema:  

| Directive | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [@model](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Object | Store objects in DynamoDB and configure CRUD resolvers. |
| [@auth](/cli/graphql/authorization-rules) on Object | Define authorization strategies for your API. |
| [@hasOne, @hasMany, @belongsTo, @manyToMany](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Field | Specify relationships between @model object types. |
| [@searchable](/cli/graphql/search-and-result-aggregations) on Object | Stream data of an @model object type to the Amazon OpenSearch Service. |
| [@primaryKey and @index](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Object | Index your data with keys. |
| [@function](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#lambda-function-resolver) on Field | Connect Lambda resolvers to your API. |
| [@predictions](/cli/graphql/connect-to-machine-learning-services/) on Field | Connect machine learning services. |
| [@http](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#http-resolver) on Field | Configure HTTP resolvers within your API. |

You may also write your own transformers to implement reproducible patterns that you find useful.

### Mocking and Local Testing

Amplify supports running a local mock server for testing your application with AWS AppSync, including debugging of resolvers, before pushing to the cloud. Please see the [CLI Toolchain documentation](/cli/usage/mock) for more details.

### Generate client types from a GraphQL schema

When working with GraphQL data it is useful to import types from your schema for type safety. You can do this with the Amplify CLI's automated code generation feature. The CLI automatically downloads GraphQL Introspection Schemas from the defined GraphQL endpoint and generates TypeScript or Flow classes for you. Every time you push your GraphQL API, the CLI will provide you the option to generate types and statements.

If you want to generate your GraphQL statements and types, run:

```bash
amplify codegen
```

A TypeScript or Flow type definition file will be generated in your target folder.  

### API configuration in the amplify folder

The Amplify CLI will create an `amplify/backend/api` folder that will hold the existing GraphQL schema, resolvers, and additional configuration around the API. To learn more about how the CLI manages this configuration, check out the documentation [here](/cli/graphql/overview). To learn how to configure custom GraphQL resolvers, check out the documentation [here](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#override-amplify-generated-resolvers).
