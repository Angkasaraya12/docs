<Callout warning>

To enable browser password manager, wrap the Authenticator component with an `AmplifyAuthContainer`.

```jsx
import {
  AmplifyAuthContainer,
  AmplifyAuthenticator,
} from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";

<AmplifyAuthContainer>
  <AmplifyAuthenticator />
</AmplifyAuthContainer>
```

</Callout>
