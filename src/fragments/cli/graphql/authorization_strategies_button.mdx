  Below is a short comparison between the different authentication types and their use cases. 

| **Recommended use case** | **Strategy** | **Provider** |
|---|---|---|
| Public data access where users or devices are anonymous. Anyone with the AppSync API key is granted access. | [`public`]() | `apiKey` |
| Recommended for production environment's public data access. Public data access where unauthenticated users or devices are granted permissions using AWS IAM controls. | [`public`]() | `iam` |
| Per user data access. Access is restricted to the "owner" of a record. Leverages `amplify add auth` Cognito user pool by default. | [`owner`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Any signed-in data access. Unlike owner-based access, **any** signed-in user has access. | [`private`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` / `iam` |
| Per user group data access. A specific or dynamically configured group of users have access | [`group`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Define your own custom authorization rule within a Lambda function | [`custom`]() | `function` |
