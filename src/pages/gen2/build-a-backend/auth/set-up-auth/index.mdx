In this guide, you will learn how to set up Amplify Auth. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources and enabling sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out with the Authenticator UI component. We will also provide more context on how resources are managed and created with Amplify to help you make decisions and understand any long-term impact of those decisions.

Before you begin, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14.4 or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later

## Set up and connect backend resources

First you will need to set up your Amplify app before defining your Amplify Auth resources.

### Set up your Amplify app

You can create a new Amplify app by running the command below in your terminal.

```bash title=Terminal
npm create amplify
```

Once your Amplify app is created, you will see a `backend` folder that is created in your app project. If you navigate to your backend folder, you will see an `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file that contains the definition of your Amplify Auth resources.

### Decide how to manage authentication

You can set up either sign in mechanisms that work with an email/phone and password, use passwordless authentication with Magic Link and One-time password, or use social provider sign-in.

<Accordion title='Understanding Auth high-level concepts' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

- _Authentication_ is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as _AuthN_). The system that does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
- _Authorization_ is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as _AuthZ_). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include:

- Username/password which is simple to set up but prone to compromise.
- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties.

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by:

- Adding password policies that ensure stronger passwords are created by your users.
- Requiring additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.

</Accordion>

<Callout>

At a minimum you will need to pass a `loginWith` value to set up how your users sign into your app. Signing in with email and password is set up by default if you do not provide any value.

</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
});
```

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery, and other operations. If you have not worked with Amazon Cognito before, we recommend taking a closer look at Amazon Cognito configuration options before you continue, since some of them are irreversible after your resources are created.

<Accordion title='Review Amazon Cognito configuration options' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amazon Cognito can be customized based on your security strategy for authentication. However, some initial configuration options cannot be changed after the backend resources are configured:

- User attributes that are used to identify your individual users (such as username and email) cannot be renamed or deleted.
- Sign-in methods (including username, email, and phone) cannot be added or changed after the initial configuration. This includes both defining which attributes are used to sign in and which attributes are required. Required attributes must have a value for all users once set.
- Verification methods (including username and email) are the same as required attributes and cannot be removed once configured.
- The `sub` attribute is a unique identifier within each user pool that cannot be modified and can be used to index and search users.
- If MFA is set to **required** for all users, you will need to include MFA setup when users sign up.

See the [Amazon Cognito documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) for more details on these settings, including [User pool attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) and [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).

</Accordion>

### Test authentication

After you have chosen and set up your authentication management, you can run the below command to test your newly created Auth resource.

```bash title=Terminal
npx amplify sandbox
```

This command will also generate a configuration file to enable your frontend app to connect to your backend resources. If you enable any of these values, they will also be available as user profile attributes for any users you create.

You now have set up and configured your backend resources for Amplify Auth, and connected your frontend app to your backend. You are now ready to work on your frontend application.

## Build with Authenticator

Creating the sign-in flow can be quite difficult and time-consuming to get right. However, Amplify has the Authenticator UI component which you can use to quickly build the entire authentication flow for your app. The Authenticator works seamlessly with configuration in `amplify/auth/resource.ts` to automatically work with your backend.

You can add the Authenticator connected UI component by wrapping it in your app's entry point.

```ts title="pages/_app.ts"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import config from '../amplifyconfiguration';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

Amplify.configure(config);

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
        <main>
          <h1>Hello {user.username}</h1>
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </main>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  );
}
```

You can then check if the user is authenticated before allowing access to your app. Here is an example using middleware in a Next.js application.

```ts
// in Next.js middleware with the App Router
import { runInMiddleware, runInServerComponent, runInServerAction, runInServiceRoute } from "@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs";
import { fetchAuthSession } from "aws-amplify/auth/server";
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const response = NextResponse.next();

  const authenticated = await runWithAmplifyServerContext({
    nextServerContext: { request, response },
    operation: async (contextSpec) => {
      try {
        const session = await fetchAuthSession(contextSpec);
        return session.tokens !== undefined;
      } catch (error) {
        console.log(error);
        return false;
      }
    }
  });

  const authentication = await runInMiddleware(async (contextSpec) => {
    const session = await fetchAuthSession(contextSpec)
    const url = await getUrl(contextSpec, {
      accessLevel: // ...
    })
  })
}
```

Once you add the Authenticator component to your app, you can test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality. You can also [customize the Authenticator UI component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator/customization) to adjust colors and styling as needed.

### View the created user in the AWS Console

After creating a new user, you can validate the created user in the Amazon Cognito console. To do so, you can use `amplify console auth` to open the AWS Console directly. Note the user's status should be `CONFIRMED` if you successfully verified the user; however, it can be in `UNCONFIRMED` if the user is not yet verified. You can also check to make sure your user attributes are updating correctly.

You now have enabled sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out for your authentication and verified its functionality with a test user.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Set up Amplify Auth** guide. In this guide, you set up and connected to backend resources, compared and determined your Auth integration path, and enabled sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.
