Lambda functions' IAM execution role do not immediately grant access to Amplify Data's API because the API operates on a "deny-by-default"-basis. Access need to be explicitly granted.

To grant an external AWS Resource or an IAM role access to Amplify Data's API, you need to explicitly list the IAM role by adding them to `allowListedRoleNames` property.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    description: a.string(),
  }),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // Pass in the Lambda Execution Role names to grant full read/write access to the API
    // if their IAM policies permit it.
    allowListedRoleNames: ["lambdaRole"],
  },
});
```

These "Allow-listed Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `.authorization()` rule.
