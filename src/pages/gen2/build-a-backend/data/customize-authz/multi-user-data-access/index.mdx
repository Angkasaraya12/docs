You can override the default owners field name by specifying inField with the desired field name to store the owner information. This allows dynamically managing which users can access a record by updating the owner field."

If you want to grant a set of users access to a record, you use the `multipleOwners` rule, this automatically creates a `owner: a.string().array()` field to store the allowed owners.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.multipleOwners()
  ])
})
```

You can override the `inField` to a list of owners. Use this if you want a dynamic set of users to have access to a record.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
    authors: a.string().array() // record owner information now stored in "authors" field
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.multipleOwners().inField("authors")
  ])
})
```

In the example above, upon record creation, the `authors` list is populated with the creator of the record. The creator can then update the `authors` field with additional users. Any user listed in the `authors` field can access the record.
