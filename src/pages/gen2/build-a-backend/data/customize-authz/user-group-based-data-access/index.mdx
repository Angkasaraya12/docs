To restrict access based on user groups, use the `group` authorization strategy. The user group authorization strategy allows restricting data access to specific user groups or groups defined dynamically on each data record.

## Add authorization rules for specific user groups

When you want to restrict access to a specific set of user groups, provide the group names in the `groups` parameter.

```ts
// allow one specific group
export const schema = a.schema({
  Salary: a.model({
    wage: a.float(),
    currency: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.specificGroup("Admin")
  ])
})
```
```ts
// allow multiple specific groups
export const schema = a.schema({
  Salary: a.model({
    wage: a.float(),
    currency: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.specificGroups(["Admin", "Leadership"])
  ])
})
```

In the example above, only users that are part of the "Admin" user group are granted access to the Salary model.

## Add authorization rules for dynamically set user groups

```ts
// Dynamic group authorization with multiple groups
a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string()
    groups: a.string().array()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.groupsDefinedInField('groups'),
  ])
})
```

```ts
// Dynamic group authorization with a single group
a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string()
    groups: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.groupDefinedInField('groups'),
  ])
})
```

With dynamic group authorization, each record contains an attribute specifying what Cognito groups should be able to access it. Use the first argument to specify which attribute in the underlying data store holds this group information. To specify that a single group should have access, use a field of type `a.string()`. To specify that multiple groups should have access, use a field of type `a.string().array()`.

By default, `group` authorization leverages Amazon Cognito user pool groups but you can also use OpenID Connect with `group` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider).

**Known limitations for real-time subscriptions when using dynamic group authorization**:

1. If you authorize based on a single group per record, then subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 5 or fewer user groups
2. If you authorize via an array of groups (`groups: a.string().array()` example above),
  - subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 20 or fewer groups
  - you can only authorize 20 or fewer user groups per record
