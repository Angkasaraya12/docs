**In Amplify Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications (e.g. Authentication, Analytics, API, DataStore, Geo, Predictions etc.). Are those same categories available in Gen 2?**

In the launch of public preview, Amplify code-first (Gen 2) supports auth and data. Other use cases can be implemented using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs.

**What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to my application in Gen 2?
**

Because Amplify builds on the AWS CDK, any of the 175+ AWS service can can be added to the project using custom resources <link here> and L2/L1 AWS CDK Constructs.

**We are planning to build and release a new application before the code-first developer experience is generally available, which version of Amplify should we use?**

Amplify’s GraphQL and Auth CDK constructs are generally available. We recommend using these with Amplify’s tooling-first (Gen 1) developer experience. This will help you seamlessly transition to Amplify code-first (Gen 2) when it is no longer in preview.

**Is Amplify Gen 2 backward compatible with existing Amplify projects on Gen 1**?
No

**Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2**?
While Amplify Gen 2 is in public preview, we will have migration guides which describe how to manually move from Gen 1 to Gen 2. At GA, we will have tooling which will help developers move projects from Gen 1 to Gen 2.

**What platforms will Amplify Gen 2 support?**
While in public preview, Amplify Gen 2 supports a TypeScript first developer experience for building backends. Teams that have built backends with Amplify Gen 2 can reuse that backend in mobile apps if desired.

 
**Whichweb frameworks will have first-class support?**
Amplify Gen 2 offers support for all web frameworks that are supported in the Amplify libraries (currently Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular).

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support mobile development?**
You can use a Gen 2 backend with a Swift, Kotlin, or Flutter app; however, in public preview Amplify only supports TypeScript for writing backend logic.
