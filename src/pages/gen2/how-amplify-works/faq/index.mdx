**In Amplify Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications (e.g., Authentication, Analytics, API, DataStore, Geo, Predictions). Are those same categories available in Gen 2?**

In the launch of public preview, Amplify code-first (Gen 2) supports Auth and Data. Other use cases can be implemented using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs.

**What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to my application in Gen 2?**

Because Amplify builds on the AWS CDK, any of the 175+ AWS services can can be added to the project using [custom resources](/gen2/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/custom-resources/) and L2/L1 AWS CDK Constructs.

**We are planning to build and release a new application before the code-first developer experience is generally available. Which version of Amplify should we use?**

We recommend using Amplifyâ€™s tooling-first (Gen 1) developer experience with the CLI and Studio to get access to our complete feature set. If you're primary usecases are configuring auth or data, we recommend starting with our [L3 CDK constructs](/gen2/reference/cdk-constructs/) that power the Gen 2 experience,

**Is Amplify Gen 2 backward compatible with existing Amplify projects on Gen 1**? No. Amplify Gen 2 projects adopt a file-based convention with a much smaller footprint. You cannot use the Gen 1 CLI to update the Gen 2 `resource.ts` files.

**Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2**? While Amplify Gen 2 is in public preview, we will have migration guides which describe how to manually move from Gen 1 to Gen 2. At GA, we will offer tooling which will help developers move projects from Gen 1 to Gen 2.

**What platforms will Amplify Gen 2 support?** While in public preview, Amplify Gen 2 supports a TypeScript first developer experience for building backends. Teams that have built backends with Amplify Gen 2 can reuse that backend in mobile apps if desired.

**Which web frameworks will have first-class support?** Amplify Gen 2 offers support for all web frameworks that are supported in the Amplify libraries (currently Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular).

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support mobile development?** You can use a Gen 2 backend with a Swift, Kotlin, or Flutter app; however, in public preview Amplify only supports TypeScript for writing backend logic.
