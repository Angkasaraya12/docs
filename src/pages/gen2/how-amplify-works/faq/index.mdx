**In Amplify Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications (e.g., Authentication, Analytics, API, DataStore, Geo, Predictions). Are those same categories available in Gen 2?**

In the launch of public preview, Amplify code-first (Gen 2) supports Auth and Data. Other use cases can be implemented using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs.

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support DataStore?**

No, in public preview, Amplify code-first (Gen 2) supports GraphQL APIs without DataStore.

**What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to our application in Gen 2?**

Because Amplify builds on the AWS CDK, any of the 175+ AWS services can can be added to the project using [custom resources](../../build-a-backend/add-aws-services/custom-resources/) and L2/L1 AWS CDK Constructs.

**We are planning to build and release a new application before the code-first developer experience is generally available. Which version of Amplify should we use?**

Amplify’s Data and Auth CDK constructs are generally available. We recommend using these with Amplify’s tooling-first (Gen 1) developer experience. This will help you seamlessly transition to Amplify code-first (Gen 2) when it is no longer in preview.

**Is Amplify Gen 2 backward compatible with existing Amplify projects on Gen 1?**

No.

**Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2?**

While Amplify Gen 2 is in public preview, we will have migration guides that describe how to manually move from Gen 1 to Gen 2. At GA, we will have tooling that will help developers move projects from Gen 1 to Gen 2.

**What platforms will Amplify Gen 2 support?**

While in public preview, Amplify Gen 2 supports a TypeScript-first developer experience for building backends. Teams that have built backends with Amplify Gen 2 can reuse that backend in mobile apps if desired.
 
**Which web frameworks will have first-class support?**

Amplify Gen 2 offers support for all web frameworks that are supported in the Amplify libraries (currently Next.js, React, Vue, and Angular).

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support mobile development?**

You can use a Gen 2 backend with a Swift, Kotlin, or Flutter app; however, in public preview, Amplify only supports TypeScript for writing backend logic.

**What if I'm already building with AWS CDK? How should I proceed?**

If you already have an AWS CDK project, you can use the L3 constructs that Amplify provides. If you're starting a new project with auth and data, then start with Amplify because you can always use AWS CDK with it.
