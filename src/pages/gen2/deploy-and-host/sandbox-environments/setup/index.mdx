Amplify gives every developer a personal cloud sandbox environment that provides isolated development spaces to rapidly build, test, and iterate on a fullstack app. You and each developer on your team gets their own disposable sandbox environment connected to cloud resources.

## Create a new sandbox environment

You can set up a new sandbox environment on your machine once you have an Amplify app set up.  

Before you begin, you will need:

- An Amplify app set up using the [Quickstart](../../../start/quickstart/) instructions
- `@aws-amplify/backend-cli` installed in your `package.json > devDependencies`. If not, run `npm install @aws-amplify/backend-cli`
- Your local machine configured to deploy to AWS

Open the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
cd myapp
npx amplify sandbox
```

When you deploy a cloud sandbox, Amplify creates an AWS CloudFormation stack `amplify-{appName}-{$whoami}-sandbox` in your AWS account with the resources configured in your `amplify` folder.

After the successful deployment of the CloudFormation stack, the sandbox tracks and monitors for file changes in your `amplify` folder and performs real-time updates to the CloudFormation stack. This functionality is built leveraging the hotswap capability of the AWS CDK.

### Terminating a sandbox environment

After testing all the changes associated to the backend, you can terminate the sandbox session via `Ctrl+C` and can then choose whether you want to keep or delete all the resources in the sandbox environment.

## Manage sandbox environments

You can view and manage all the sandbox environments for your team in the new [Amplify console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/apps/sandboxes). This is useful for a team leader to audit all the Amplify sandbox environments deployed within an account. 

Choose **Manage Sandboxes** to get started:

You can then check the number, status, and last updates for sandbox environments across your team. You can also use the console to delete sandbox environments when no longer needed.

## Best Practices

Keep the following best practices in mind when working with cloud sandbox environments:

- Sandboxes are identical in fidelity to your production environments.
- Code changes are continuously deployed to your sandbox on every save for fast iterations.
- Use sandboxes for experimentation and testing, not for production workloads.
- Deploy one sandbox per Amplify app to prevent conflicts.
- Reset sandboxes occasionally to clear out unused resources and save costs.
