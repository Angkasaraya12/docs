## Monorepo setup

Some teams choose a monorepo approach, or single repositories that contain multiple packages or components to simplify the deployment process for shared libraries and components. Without a monorepo, you have to deploy each package individually, keep track of package versions and dependencies across packages, and ensure version compatibility. This can become exponentially more complex as the number of packages grows. With a monorepo, all packages and dependencies are contained within a single repository.

Amplify Gen 2 supports monorepo workflows for fullstack builds with monorepo tools such as Nx and yarn workspaces. When building with Amplify Gen 2, we recommend creating the `amplify` folder in a shared workspace. We will use the following example for this guide:

```text
├── apps/
│   ├── admin-dashboard/
│   │   ├── next.config.mjs
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── marketing-site/
│       ├── astro.config.mjs
│       └── package.json
├── packages/
│   └── my-shared-backend/
│       ├── amplify/
│       │   ├── auth/
│       │   │   └── resource.ts
│       │   ├── data/
│       │   │   └── resource.ts
│       │   └── backend.ts
│       |── package.json
        └── tsconfig.json
└── package.json
```

Monorepos require a slightly different setup. We are going to deploy 3 Amplify apps:

- App 1 - `shared-backend/amplify`
- App 2 - `admin-dashboard`
- App 3 - `marketing-site`

App 1 will be the only app that updates changes to the backend. The other apps will only run frontend builds that point to the shared-backend.

1. To get started, lets deploy App 1 that will contain the Amplify backend. With Gen 2, customers can now setup backend-only CI/CD apps. Navigate to the console and select _New app > Build an app (Gen 2)_.

1. Once you connect your repository, pick your monorepo project. Check the box that says _My app is a monorepo_ and enter the path to your amplify backend.

1. Your build settings should be automatically detected.
