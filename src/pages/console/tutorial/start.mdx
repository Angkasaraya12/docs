AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. To learn more, see the [Amplify Studio introduction](/console/).

Amplify Studio is available in the following regions: [Amplify Studio service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/amplify.html#amplifyadmin_region).

You can get started with or without an AWS account. Without an AWS account, you can begin modeling data for your backend and testing it locally using a [Sandbox environment](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/). If you choose to create an AWS account and deploy your backend in the AWS Amplify console, an expanded set of features becomes available for configuring your backend environment.

## Get started with your AWS account

If you already have an AWS account and you want to skip the sandbox experience, deploy Amplify Studio to start using all Amplify features, including DataStore, user authentication and authorization, and file storage. After you deploy a backend in Amplify, you can launch Amplify Studio from your Amplify project. Your entire team can use Studio to add new features, update app data, and manage users and groups.
